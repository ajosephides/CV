## Alexis Josephides

An experienced product manager making the switch to engineering with Makers Academy - a 16 week software development bootcamp.

Academic training has always been heavily analytical and I've taken this outlook and critical thinking methods into my professional career where I ask "Why?" - a lot.
It's an incredibly powerful and simple question but allows for 3 things:
- it helps to understand the problem fully, to get to the heart of details.
- it forces one to be able to explain the problem fully and reflect on one's understanding of the problem
- it forces one to really answer the question of whether this is the most valuable thing to be working on right now.

I've worked across a range of industries and disciplines (academic, travel, media and energy) and love to learn, challenge and above all solve problems within a cross-functional team.

## Skills

#### Excellent communicator

I believe this stems from being a good synthesiser of ideas - understand and be able to 'playback' to a room options that they have suggested. Be open, honest and inclusive.

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence

#### Fast Learner

Whether it be a new technology (Ruby), new industry or new problem.

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

#### Team Lead
- Get to the crux of what is the right problem to be working on and supporting a team to achieve that goal

## Experience

**Kaluza** (March'18 to April'19)    
*Senior Technical Product Manager*
I was the senior product manager at green energy startup Kaluza (formerly VCharge) responsible for all integrations with a range of appliances and technologies for electric cars, and storage heaters to wind turbines.
Here I learnt a lot quickly - how the energy industry functions to the details of how a brand of storage heater physically works the whole time trying to give a team a clear focus and constiency of work free of as much context shifting as possible in a startup environment.

**The Guardian News and Media** (March'15 to March'19)   
*(Group Product Manager, Solution Architect, Solution Analyst*

**Sunvil** (Nov'08 to March'15)
A SME tour operator where I held a number of responsibilities from some programme management, sales, copywriting, marketing, pricing and budgeting - in essence the skills needed to run a company.
