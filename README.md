# Alexis Josephides CV

## Profile
An experienced product manager making the switch to engineering having completed Makers Academy - a 12 week software development bootcamp.

I've worked across a range of industries and disciplines (academic, travel, media and energy) and love to learn, challenge and above all solve problems within a cross-functional team.

Having worked in a mixtue of commercial, technical and managerial roles across these industries for many years I  found myself being further and further removed from the problem and right now I am not ready to do so. I am taking this career switch so that I can get closer to the problems that a company faces and solve them with a set of skills that I can continue to learn and adapt.

My academic training has always been heavily analytical and I've taken this outlook and critical thinking methods into my professional career where I ask "Why?" - a lot - to myself and peers.
It's an incredibly powerful and simple question but allows for 3 things:
- it helps to understand the problem fully, to get to the heart of details.
- it forces one to be able to explain the problem fully and reflect on one's understanding of the problem
- it forces one to really answer the question of whether this is the most valuable thing to be working on right now.

## Projects
I have pinned a handful of projects to my github. I have pinned these not because of their quality but because each in its way represents a milestone.

[Takeaway Challenge](https://github.com/ajosephides/takeaway-challenge) - This project was the second weekend challenge of the Makers course. It was very early on in the course, and far from perfect, but the work here is representative of the leap in understanding when it came to concepts such as **modelling**, **TDD**, **SRP** and **Dependency Injection**.

[Makers BnB](https://github.com/petraartep/MakersBnB) - this was the first week long (5 day) project I worked on as a team. I am highlighting this because it showcased working in a team. My personal contribution to this project that I am most proud of was writing an API endpoint in the controller that then was called by a javascript frontend that also included an on page filter. Again it is far from perfect but I believe it shows good understanding of the technologies involved and the progress I made in Javascript after just one week of exposure to it.

[TFL Database](https://github.com/ajosephides/tfl-timetable-database) - a project I started working on before Makers. It is rough and hacky and has no tests but I'm proud of this work. It is illustrative of my passion for solving problems with technology. My plan is to rewrite this and extend and use this data to work on a *fairest place to meet* problem.

## Skills

#### Excellent communicator
I believe this stems from being a good synthesiser of ideas - understand and be able to 'playback' to a room options that they have suggested.  
During my time at Makers feedback I recieved on multiple occasions from my classmates was that I am excellent at explaining concepts. That I was patient and clear with my explanations and as a result a good pair partner. Being able to explain a complicated concept utilises these same core communication skills.


#### Fast and Keen Learner

Whether it be a new technology (Ruby, Javascript), new industry or new problem.
While at Makers I had my first true exposure to Javascript. Within my second of exposure I had understood the link between a Ruby backend and Javascript frontend by writing an API in Ruby that was utilised by clientside Javascript to render and then filter data. This was done without explicit direction but by thinking through the disparate concepts I had just be exposed to and then joining them together.


#### Team Lead
- Get to the crux of what is the right problem to be working on and supporting a team to achieve that goal. Over the years working as a product manager, senior product manager and group product manager this has been crucial - when resources are tight it is important to be working on the problem that will drive the most value for the business.

## Experience

**Kaluza** (March'18 to April'19)    
*Senior Technical Product Manager*
I was the senior product manager at green energy startup Kaluza (formerly VCharge) responsible for all 3rd party integrations - from storage heaters to wind turbines and everything in between.

Here I learnt a lot quickly - how the energy industry functions to the details of how a brand of storage heater physically works the whole time trying to give a team a clear focus and constiency of work free of as much context shifting as possible in a startup environment.

**The Guardian News and Media** (March'15 to March'19)   
*(Group Product Manager, Solution Architect, Solution Analyst*
I began work here as a Solution Analyst and moved quickly to become a Group Product Manager managing 3 product teams.
I worked on a range of projects and technologies from bespoke web analytics to all digital advertising across the Guardian.

**Sunvil** (Nov'08 to March'15)
A SME tour operator where I held a number of responsibilities from some programme management, sales, copywriting, marketing, pricing and budgeting - in essence the skills needed to run a company.
